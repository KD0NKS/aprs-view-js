## Descritpion
This is intended to be a fairly lightweight, cross platform, grapical APRS client.

As APRS software is very complex and I'm starting the UI 100% from scratch.  I am currently working to design a decent interface given certain limitations of the framework being used.

## Features
* Ability to connect to either an aprsc or Jav-APRS-IS server.
* See raw data packets in output window.
