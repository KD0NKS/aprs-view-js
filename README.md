APRS is a registered trademark Bob Bruninga, WB4APR.

## Descritpion
This is intended to be a fairly lightweight, cross platform, grapical APRS client.

## Status
As APRS software is very complex and I'm starting the UI 100% from scratch, there are currently no actual APRS features implemented.  I am currently working to design a decent interface given certain limitations of the framework being used.
